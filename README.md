# deeplearn

main.py: The first "deep learning"-esque code I wrote. This was the first homework for a deep learning course. The goal was, to distinguish 0 from 8. I achived this, by a one layer perceprton network. Since the task was very easy, it could produce 95+% testing accuracy in one epoch.

conv.ipynb and mlp.ipynb: These notebooks were done based on the tensorflow tutorials. The conv.ipynb implemnts a convolutional neural network, the mpl.ipynb implements a multilayer perceptron. Both use tensorflow and the mnist dataset.
